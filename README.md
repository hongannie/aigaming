In the text entry write up to 3 paragraphs explaining what you are going to work on and how you will organize your code/project
If you work on a leetcode style project, mention all the problems you decided to work on
If you work on a default project, mention which parts you will do and how you will organize your code overall
If you have a custom project, explain what it is and what needs to be done


AI project: using dynamic programming to solve a Markov decision process
For those of you who would like to combine algorithms and artificial intelligence, a possible project is to model some game as a Markov decision process and solve it using dynamic programming. These are some of the fundamental concepts behind AI methods based on reinforcement learning.

For our project, we will be using dynamic programming to solve a Markov decision process with application to a game we have chosen to model. We have chosen to model the game tic-tac-toe. This project will combine both algorithms and artificial intelligence to model the game to

**AI Gaming: Dynamic Programming (Algorithms Project)**

In the text entry write up to 3 paragraphs explaining what you are going to work on and how you will organize your code/project
If you work on a leetcode style project, mention all the problems you decided to work on
If you work on a default project, mention which parts you will do and how you will organize your code overall
If you have a custom project, explain what it is and what needs to be done



For our project, we will be using dynamic programming to solve a Markov decision process with application to a game we have chosen to model. We have chosen to model the game tic-tac-toe. This project will combine both algorithms and artificial intelligence to model the game to where the AI will be forced to compute the best action to take against in response to every move made by the user. 

To start off, we will have to break down the process into several steps. The first thing we would have to do would be to determine the different states of the game that could play out. The best way to do so would be by drawing a Markov model by hand that depicts the different states and different paths that the game could take based on the play of the user.

The next step to this process would be implementing this project through code. We are anticipating to have to implement this in 3 parts. We would have to make one file that implements the dynamic programming for the AI, one file that implements the game itself, and then another file that will simulate the code. We intend to implement the game and the dynamic programming through python and then simulate the code by creating a javascript and html file that simulates the game on a webpage. For the implementation of the game board, we plan to use an array to keep track of the moves of the user and the AI. For the Markov decision process, we plan to use a list of size 3, or triples, describing all the possible combinations.

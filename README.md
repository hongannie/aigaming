AI project: using dynamic programming to solve a Markov decision process
For those of you who would like to combine algorithms and artificial intelligence, a possible project is to model some game as a Markov decision process and solve it using dynamic programming. These are some of the fundamental concepts behind AI methods based on reinforcement learning.





For our project, we will be using dynamic programming to solve a Markov decision process with application to a game we have chosen to model. We have chosen to model the game tic-tac-toe. This project will combine both algorithms and artificial intelligence to model the game to where the AI will be forced to compute the best action to take against in response to every move made by the user. 

For this project, we will have to break down the process into several steps. The first thing we would have to do would be to determine the different states of the game that could play out. The best way to do so would be by drawing a Markov model by hand that depicts the differnt states and different paths that the game could take based on the play of the user.
